To configure your shell to load `flux` [bash completions](./cmd/flux_completion_bash.md) add to your profile:

```sh
. <(flux completion bash)
```
[`zsh`](/docs/cmd/flux_completion_zsh), [`fish`](/docs/cmd/flux_completion_fish),
and [`powershell`](/docs/cmd/flux_completion_powershell)
are also supported with their own sub-commands.
