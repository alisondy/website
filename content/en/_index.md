Flux is a set of continuous and progressive delivery solutions for Kubernetes, and they are open and extensible.

Flux v2 will be GA within the next few months! This means that Flux v1 will be deprecated before the end of 2021, so now is a good time to start using v2.

# **GitOps at your fingertips**

#### Flux is a collection of tools for keeping [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) clusters in sync with sources of configuration (like Git repositories), and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy.

</div>

{{% blocks/feature icon="fab fa-git-square fa-3x" title="Declarative" height="auto" color="primary" %}}

Describe the entire desired state of your system in [Git](https://git-scm.com). This includes apps, configuration,
dashboards, monitoring, and everything else.

{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-robot fa-3x" title="Automated" height="auto"%}}

  Use [YAML](https://yaml.org) to enforce conformance to the declared system. 
  You don't need to run [`kubectl`](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/) because all changes are synced automatically.

{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-code fa-3x" title="Auditable" height="auto"  %}}

  Everything is controlled through pull requests. Your Git history provides a sequence of transactions, allowing you to
  recover state from any snapshot.

{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-drafting-compass fa-3x" title="Designed for Kubernetes" height="auto"  %}}

  Declaratively configurable using Custom Resources, state reports in the
  [object's status](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#object-spec-and-status)
  and via [Kubernetes Events](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-application-introspection/),
  and integrations with Kubernetes RBAC

{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-box-open fa-3x" title="Out-of-the-box integrations" height="auto" %}}

Support for e.g. [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io), [Helm](https://helm.sh); GitHub, GitLab, Harbor and custom
webhooks; notifications to most team communication platforms; and many more.

{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-cube fa-3x" title="Extensible" height="auto"%}}

Easily create a continous delivery solution with only the components you need, or use the [GitOps Toolkit](#gitops-toolkit)
to extend Flux.

# **Other Flux projects**

</div>

{{% blocks/project title="GitOps Toolkit"
  image="/img/building-blocks.svg" image-align="left" bg-color="primary"
%}}

The set of APIs and controllers that make up the runtime for Flux. You can use the GitOps Toolkit to extend Flux, and to build your own systems for continuous delivery.

{{% /blocks/project %}}

{{% blocks/project title="Flagger"
  image="/img/flagger-gitops.png" image-align="right" bg-color="green"
%}}

Kubernetes Operator for the automation of promoting canary deployments using Istio, Linkerd, App Mesh, NGINX, Skipper, Contour, Gloo or Traefik routing for traffic shifting, and Prometheus metrics for canary analysis.

The canary analysis can be extended with webhooks for running system integration/acceptance tests, load tests, or any other custom validation.

 %}}

We owe our success and good reputation as GitOps project to Flux and Helm Operator. They are the v1 iteration of our project and currently in [maintenance mode](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux/issues/3320).

We strongly advise everyone to familiarize themselves with Flux v2 and start the process of migrating.

#### The Flux project aspires to be the vendor-neutral home for GitOps in a Cloud Native world.

#### What we achieved up until today is only possible because of our community.
