title: Flux - the GitOps family of projects
description: > 
  Flux is a set of continuous and progressive delivery solutions for Kubernetes, and they are open and extensible. 
  
  Flux v2 will be GA within the next few months! 
  
  This means that Flux v1 will be deprecated before the end of 2021, so now is a good time to start using v2.

Describe the entire desired state of your system in [Git](https://git-scm.com). This includes apps, configuration,
dashboards, monitoring, and everything else.

  Use [YAML](https://yaml.org) to enforce conformance to the declared system. You don't need to run
  [`kubectl`](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/) because all changes are synced automatically.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-code fa-3x" title="Auditable" height="auto" color="blue" %}}

  Everything is controlled through pull requests. Your Git history provides a sequence of transactions, allowing you to
  recover state from any snapshot.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-drafting-compass fa-3x" title="Designed for Kubernetes" height="auto" color="blue" %}}

  Declaratively configurable using Custom Resources, state reports in the
  [object's status](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#object-spec-and-status)
  and via [Kubernetes Events](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-application-introspection/),
  and integrations with Kubernetes RBAC

{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-box-open fa-3x" title="Out-of-the-box integrations" height="auto" color="blue" %}}

Support for e.g. [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io), [Helm](https://helm.sh); GitHub, GitLab, Harbor and custom
webhooks; notifications to most team communication platforms; and many more.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-cube fa-3x" title="Extensible" height="auto" color="blue" %}}

Easily create a continous delivery solution with only the components you need, or use the [GitOps Toolkit](#gitops-toolkit)
to extend Flux.
