Flux welcomes improvements from all contributors, new and experienced!

The flux website uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Docsy theme](https://www.docsy.dev/).
Documentation is written in Markdown.

To get a good sense of the general mechanics of the repository and what your options are of running the site locally, please visit <https://github.com/fluxcd/website/#readme>.

In this section we will focus on common use-cases of folks who contribute to docs.
